// Connect to local DB (since we can't access production DB directly, 
// but wait, the user is running on Render with a remote DB? 
// No, the previous log said "MONGODB_URI is NOT set! Falling back to localhost." 
// BUT then later "Connected to MongoDB ... MONGODB_URI length: 128".
// So they ARE using a remote DB.
// I cannot access the remote DB from here directly unless I have the URI.
// I don't have the URI.
// However, I can add a temporary route to the server to inspect this, 
// OR I can ask the user to run a script? No, user can't run scripts easily.
// I will add a temporary GET route to `server/server.js` or `server/routes/products.js` 
// that dumps the specific product and its batches.
// actually, I can just use the existing logging in `sync.js` if I trigger a sync?
// No, sync logs only show what's coming FROM the sheet.
// I need to see what's IN the DB.

// I'll add a temporary debug route: GET /api/debug/product/:name
